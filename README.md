# Front End Project 1

Part of being a great developer means learning to learn on your own, and picking projects that matter to you as a ways of improving your coding skills. Ask any great coder, and they'll tell you the same thing: they got great at what they do by choosing big projects and working hard to make them a reality.

For your first project, you'll be building a website using HTML and CSS that tells people more about you, or about a cause or organization that you think is important.

## Instructions

This is an open-ended project that should take you between 3 and 5 hours to complete. If you want to go further and continue working on it - that's a huge bonus for you!

Your website should have the following specifications:

1. At least 4 individual HTML pages
2. Linking between the pages (using a navigation bar)
3. A CSS stylesheet with at least 20 different selectors and properties
4. At least 5 Images
5. h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li, divs tags
5. Google Fonts

## Options

You are encouraged to build a website about something that matters to you:
+ A personal website about you, your resume, your interests, and accomplishments.
+ A website for a business that you know needs one (or redesign the website for an existing business).
+ A website about a particular issue or problem facing your community.
+ A website for one of your classes listing important information for students and teachers.

**Good Luck!**
